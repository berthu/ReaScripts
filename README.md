# ReaScripts

## speed_trainer.lua
## Script requires REAPER version >= 5.18
A speed/tempo trainer! Pretty self explanatory. Make a time selection, then point the cursor at the start of the loop, and run the script.
I recommend turning ON preroll on play.
Instructions:
* 1. Load it up in the Actions Menu and bind it to a key if you wish.
* 2. Make a time selection
* 3. Run the script. Choose a playrate to start and end with, how big you want the playrate increments to be and how frequently they should be incremented.
* 4. Press `<ESC>` or `<SPC>` at the dialogue to quit. 

## quick_playrate_set.lua
Shortcut action to change the playrate. Bind it to a key. I like Cmd + !
